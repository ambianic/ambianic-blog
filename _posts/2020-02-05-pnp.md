# Private AI powered security cameras without the cloud login

Many of us are excited about the modern AI powered security camera systems that give us a peace of mind while away from home or workspace.
Its far more helful for security systems to recognize and alert on important events such as burglary or fire rather than dedicated human eyes watching endlessly uneventful monitors. 

## Proprietary Vendor Cloud Systems

The most popular solutions that have emerged from big and small brands offer easy installation process and a plug-and-play experience with a vendor cloud service.

However most of these systems rely on processing camera footage in the vendor cloud which exposes users to serious privacy issues, such as:
- [Leveraging user data for targeted advertisement](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/products/nest-cam-indoor-security-camera/). 
- [Sharing data with law enforcement](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/08/five-concerns-about-amazon-rings-deals-police) without user consent.
- [Sending data to foreign governments](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/08/21/2000-banned-chinese-surveillance-cameras-keep-watch-over-us-government-sites/#5217d2e47f65)
- [Leaking user data due to product bugs](https://www.securityinfowatch.com/residential-technologies/news/21119783/report-wyze-exposed-info-of-millions-of-customers-in-data-breach)
- [Data breach by hackers](https://www.newsweek.com/ring-amazon-cameras-cybersecurity-passwords-easy-hacking-internet-connected-1477442)

Here is a relevant diagram of cloud dependent security cameras with a [related discussion](https://www.quora.com/Can-I-setup-an-IP-camera-without-DVR-How) on Quora. Plug-and-play convenience at the expense of compromised user privacy.

## Direct Internet Connectivity with Firewall Configuration

An alternative approach is to not use a proprietary vendor cloud to store, process and share camera footage. Instead enable users to directly connect to their security systems at home. Direct connectivity from user's mobile device to another device not hosted on the public cloud but instead residing behind a local router firewall is a technical challenge. A typical solution [requires](https://www.cctvcameraworld.com/setup-free-ddns-on-security-camera-systems/)
advanced user knowledge of router configuration, [port forwarding](https://www.lorextechnology.com/self-serve/remote-video-access-frequently-asked-questions/R-sc4600042), [DDNS](https://blog.adiglobal.us/how-ddns-works/)
and secure tunneling. Quite an effort compared to the plug-and-play convenience of cloud powered systems.

## Plug-and-play without compromising privacy

What if we can find a way to keep things plug-and-play easy, without compromising privacy?

Fortunately technology evolves fast and we have arrived at a time when this is possible. Below we will go over the solution used by Ambianic.ai - an open source ambient intelligence project.

## Basic setup

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `filename` is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. `.md` is the file extension for markdown files.

The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a "*level 1 heading*" in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line `## File names` above.

## Basic formatting

You can use *italics*, **bold**, `code font text`, and create [links](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Here's a footnote [^1]. Here's a horizontal rule:

---

## Lists

Here's a list:

- item 1
- item 2

And a numbered list:

1. item 1
1. item 2

## Boxes and stuff

> This is a quotation

{% include alert.html text="You can include alert boxes" %}

...and...

{% include info.html text="You can include info boxes" %}

## Images

![](/images/logo.png "fast.ai's logo")

## Code

General preformatted text:

    # Do a thing
    do_thing()

Python code and output:

```python
# Prints '2'
print(1+1)
```

    2
