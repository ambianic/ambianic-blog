# The future is now: Plug-and-play, Privacy Preserving Surveilance Cameras. No cloud login required!

Many of us are excited about the modern AI powered security camera systems that give us a peace of mind while away from home or workspace.
Its far more effefctive and economical for automated security systems to recognize and alert on important events such as burglary or fire rather than dedicated human eyes watching endlessly uneventful monitors. 

## Plug-and-Play with Proprietary Vendor Cloud Service

Most popular solutions that have emerged on the market in the recent years offer easy plug-and-play experience attached to a proprietary cloud service. By design, these systems upload, store and process camera footage in their vendor cloud. The ease of use is a major beneift. However exposing user data to the public cloud comes with serious privacy issues. Despite substantial efforts and promises by vendors to protect user privacy, nearly all - big and small - fail to deliver. A few notable examples of data privacy violations:
- [Leveraging user data for targeted advertisement](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/products/nest-cam-indoor-security-camera/). 
- [Sharing data with law enforcement](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/08/five-concerns-about-amazon-rings-deals-police) without user consent.
- [Sending data to foreign governments](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/08/21/2000-banned-chinese-surveillance-cameras-keep-watch-over-us-government-sites/#5217d2e47f65)
- [Leaking user data due to product bugs](https://www.securityinfowatch.com/residential-technologies/news/21119783/report-wyze-exposed-info-of-millions-of-customers-in-data-breach)
- [Data breach by hackers](https://www.newsweek.com/ring-amazon-cameras-cybersecurity-passwords-easy-hacking-internet-connected-1477442)

The following diagram illustrates a typical architecture of cloud attached security cameras with a [related discussion](https://www.quora.com/Can-I-setup-an-IP-camera-without-DVR-How) on Quora. Plug-and-play convenience at the expense of compromised user privacy.

## Direct Connectivity with Advanced Firewall Configuration

An alternative approach is to not use a proprietary vendor cloud to store, process and share camera footage. Instead enable users to directly connect to their security systems at home. Direct connectivity from user's mobile device to their private IoT device residing behind a local firewall avoids the cloud security issues. However its a much bigger technical challenge than connecting to a public web service.

A [typical technical solution](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/remote/) requires
advanced user knowledge of [router configuration]((https://www.cctvcameraworld.com/setup-free-ddns-on-security-camera-systems/)), [port forwarding](https://www.lorextechnology.com/self-serve/remote-video-access-frequently-asked-questions/R-sc4600042), [DDNS](https://blog.adiglobal.us/how-ddns-works/), ISP policies
and secure tunneling. Quite an effort compared to the plug-and-play convenience of cloud attached systems.

## Plug-and-Play without the privacy compromising cloud service

What if there is a way to keep things plug-and-play easy, without compromising privacy?

Fortunately technology evolves fast and we have arrived at a time when this is possible. Below we will go over the solution used by [Ambianic.ai](https://Ambianic.ai) - an open source ambient intelligence project.

Ambianic provides an Airdrop-like user experience connecting its Progressive Web App - [Ambianic UI](https://ui.ambianic.ai/) to a locally  installed [Ambianic Edge](https://github.com/ambianic/ambianic-edge) device.

Users can access Ambianic UI from anywhere and connect securely to their private Ambianic Edge device. They can also install it as a native desktop or mobile app on their favorite client device.

### Ambianic UI Plug-and-Play Discovery of Ambianic Edge

When the user starts Ambianic Edge for the first time on their local network, they are asked to access Ambianic UI from a client device that is also connected at the time on the same WiFi/LAN. Both the Edge device and UI register with the Ambianic PnP service, which performs an ephemeral registrar function. Its a simple matchamking function which relies on two common sense assumptions:
1. Users secure their local area network thoughtfully and only allow trusted devices to join.
2. Devices on the same local network share the same public IP when accessing public web services.

Through the Ambianic PnP registrar, UI and Edge are able to exchange each other's unique identifiers (crypto strong UUID4 strings). The following diagram illustrates the discovery stage:

## Basic setup

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `filename` is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. `.md` is the file extension for markdown files.

The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a "*level 1 heading*" in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line `## File names` above.

## Basic formatting

You can use *italics*, **bold**, `code font text`, and create [links](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Here's a footnote [^1]. Here's a horizontal rule:

## Lists

Here's a list:

- item 1

And a numbered list:

1. item 1

## Boxes and stuff

> This is a quotation

{% include alert.html text="You can include alert boxes" %}

...and...

{% include info.html text="You can include info boxes" %}

## Images

## Code

General preformatted text:

    # Do a thing
    do_thing()

Python code and output:

```python
# Prints '2'
print(1+1)
```
